**Task 1:**
Titanic Survival Detection Description: This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. We will use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. We will explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and train a machine learning model to make predictions. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the survival of passengers based on the available features.

**Task 2:**
Movie rating prediction is a complex task, as it involves analyzing a multitude of factors that influence user and critic opinions. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the rating of a movie, given its characteristics. This project presents an exciting opportunity to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.Movie rating prediction is a multifaceted problem that involves analyzing a vast array of factors that influence user and critic opinions. From the genre and director to the cast and plot, each element plays a crucial role in shaping the overall rating of a movie. The task is further complicated by the subjective nature of movie ratings, which can vary greatly depending on personal taste, cultural context, and critical reception.

**Task 3:**
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let's embark on the journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python.
